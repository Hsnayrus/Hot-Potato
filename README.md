# Hot-Potato
A ringmaster game that allows multiple users to play on different computers(on the same network or a different one). A hot-potato, with a fixed number of hops is released by the Ringmaster to a random player, who is supposed to pass the potato to a random neighbor(among 2 neighbors), until the potato has 0 hops left. In which case the ringmaster declares the winner. Socket-Programming based project
